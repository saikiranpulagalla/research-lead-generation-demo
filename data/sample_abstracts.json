We present a novel framework for predicting drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in preclinical development, utilizing engineered tissue models that better recapitulate in vivo hepatic responses. Our methodology demonstrates 95% accuracy in identifying hepatotoxic compounds compared to traditional 2D models, offering a paradigm shift in safety assessment protocols."
